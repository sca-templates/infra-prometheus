# Prometheus — Claude Code

This project is shared between agents: the canonical service guide lives in
`AGENTS.md` (imported below) and the Prometheus skills live in
`.claude/skills/` (also registered for opencode via `opencode.jsonc`).

Claude Code priorities:

- Consult `.claude/skills/` first — Claude auto-invokes a skill when a task
  matches its description.
- Consult the ecosystem documentation in the
  [sca-docs](https://github.com/sca-node-template/sca-docs) repository before
  documenting or touching topology/ports/networks — start at
  `00-ecosystem/conventions.md` and `04-infrastructure/INDEX.md`, and keep the
  vault in sync when this repo changes.
- Use the `codegraph` MCP server (`codegraph_explore`) before grep/read for
  code questions.
- Run `make validate` before finishing any change and report the result.
